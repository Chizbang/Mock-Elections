# Mock elections

This website is basically about a parody 2015 UK election poll to determine public opinion on UK politics. (**although not seriously, this is mainly comical**) 

The poll has 4 of the major political parties at this moment in time and is not meant to represent any views of my political outlook.

On mobile devices, the site nicely scales down for ease of use thanks to its responsive CSS. It also takes advantage of the Animation.css stylesheet for the awesome animations on the attention page.


Theres more work that needs to be done as this is **not** the final product, Il put up a live link of the website when I am certain its complete enough for me to show.
